In python, hash tables are most commonly implemented using dictionaries(dict)
and set (set). Both rely on hashing under the hood to provide average O(1) time
complexity for lookups, insertions and deletions.
So you do not have to worry about implementing hash functions, neither lookup,
insertion and deletion functions as you would do in other languages as C,
because python do that for you.
